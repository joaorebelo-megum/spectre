/*!
 * \brief Interpolate data in volume files to target points
 *
 * \tparam Dim Dimension of the domain
 * \param volume_files_or_glob The list of H5 files, or a glob pattern
 * \param subfile_name The name of the subfile in the H5 files containing the
 * volume data
 * \param observation Either the observation ID as a `size_t`, or the index of
 * the observation in the volume files to interpolate as an `int` (a value of 0
 * would be the first observation, and a value of -1 would be the last
 * observation).
 * \param tensor_components The tensor components to interpolate, e.g.
 * "Lapse", "Shift_x", "Shift_y", "Shift_z", "SpatialMetric_xx", etc.
 * Look into the H5 file to see what components are available.
 * \param target_points The points to interpolate to, in inertial coordinates.
 * \param extrapolate_into_excisions Enables extrapolation into excision regions
 * of the domain (default is `false`). This can be useful to fill the excision
 * region with (constraint-violating but smooth) data so it can be imported into
 * moving puncture codes. Specifically, we implement the strategy used in
 * \cite Etienne2008re adjusted for distorted excisions: we choose uniformly
 * spaced radial anchor points spaced as $\Delta r = 0.3 r_\mathrm{AH}$ in the
 * grid frame (where the excision is spherical), then map the anchor points to
 * the distorted frame (where we have the target point) and do a 7th order
 * polynomial extrapolation into the excision region.
 * \param num_threads The number of threads to use if OpenMP is linked in. If
 * not specified, OpenMP will determine the number of threads automatically.
 * It's also possible to set the number of threads using the environment
 * variable OMP_NUM_THREADS. It's an error to specify num_threads if OpenMP is
 * not linked in. Set num_threads to 1 to disable OpenMP.
 * \return std::vector<std::vector<double>> The interpolated data. The first
 * dimension corresponds to the selected tensor components, and the second
 * dimension corresponds to the target points.
