"""Tools for parsing YAML input files

To simply read an input file as a dictionary, use a standard YAML parser like
PyYAML or ruaml.yaml::

    import yaml
    with open(input_file_path) as open_input_file:
        metadata, input_file = yaml.safe_load_all(open_input_file)

It's also possible to load just the metadata without the overhead of parsing the
full input file::

    with open(input_file_path) as open_input_file:
        metadata = next(yaml.safe_load_all(open_input_file))

The functions in this module provide additional functionality to work with input
files.
