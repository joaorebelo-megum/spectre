 * \brief Items related to solving for irrotational Binary Neutron Star initial
 * data.
 *
 * We solve the equations for the relativistic quasi-equilibrium configuration
 * associated with an object in a quasi-circular orbit around a binary
 * companion.  We assume the compact object is nonspinning, which allows the
 * solution to be written in terms of a "velocity potential", which is a
 * function \f$\Phi\f$ such that \f$D_i \Phi = \rho h u_i\f$, with \f$ \rho,
 * h\f$ the rest mass density and specific enthalpy respectively, and \f$u_i \f$
 * the spatial part of the four velocity
