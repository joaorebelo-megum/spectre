# Installation on Clusters {#installation_on_clusters}

\tableofcontents

The installation instructions are the same for most systems because we use shell
scripts to set up the environment for each supercomputer. We describe the
generic installation instructions once, and only note special instructions if
necessary for the particular system. If you have already built SpECTRE and just
want to load the modules, source the shell file for your system and run
`spectre_load_modules`.

\note Sample submit scripts for some systems are available in
`support/SubmitScripts`.

## General Instructions

1. Run `export SPECTRE_HOME=/path/to/where/you/want/to/clone`
2. Clone SpECTRE using `git clone SPECTRE_URL $SPECTRE_HOME` where the
   `SPECTRE_URL` is the GitHub url you want to use to clone the repo.
3. Run `cd $SPECTRE_HOME && mkdir build && cd build`
4. Run `. $SPECTRE_HOME/support/Environments/SYSTEM_TO_RUN_ON_gcc.sh`, where
   `SYSTEM_TO_RUN_ON` is replaced by the name of the system as described in the
   relevant section below.
5. If you haven't already installed the dependencies, run
   `export SPECTRE_DEPS=/path/to/where/you/want/the/deps`
   Then run `spectre_setup_modules $SPECTRE_DEPS`. This
   will take a while to finish. Near the end the command will tell you how to
   make the modules available by providing a `module use` command. Make
   sure you are providing an absolute path to `spectre_setup_modules`.
6. Run `module use $SPECTRE_DEPS/modules`
7. Run `spectre_run_cmake`, if you get module loading errors run
   `spectre_unload_modules` and try running `spectre_run_cmake` again. CMake
   should set up successfully.
8. Build the targets you are interested in by running, e.g.
   `make -j4 test-executables`

## Anvil at Purdue University

You should build and run tests on a compute node. You can get a compute node by
running
```
sinteractive -N1 -n 20 -p debug -t 60:00
```
Avoid running `module purge` because this also removes various default modules
that are necessary for proper operation. Instead, use `module
restore`. Currently the tests can only be run in serial, e.g. `ctest -j1`
because all the MPI jobs end up being launched on the same core.

## Frontera at TACC

Follow the general instructions, using `frontera` for `SYSTEM_TO_RUN_ON`.

Processes running on the head nodes have restrictions on memory use
that will prevent linking the main executables.  It is better to
compile on an interactive node.  Interactive nodes can be requested
with the `idev` command.

For unknown reasons, incremental builds work poorly on frontera.
Running `make` will often unnecessarily recompile SpECTRE libraries.

## CaltechHPC at Caltech

Cluster documentation: https://www.hpc.caltech.edu

Follow the general instructions, using `caltech_hpc` for `SYSTEM_TO_RUN_ON`,
except you don't need to install any dependencies, so you can skip step 5 and
step 6.

There are multiple types of compute nodes on CaltechHPC, which are listed on
https://www.hpc.caltech.edu/resources. We compile SpECTRE to be compatible with
all of them.

When you go to build, you will need to get an interactive node (login nodes
limit the amount of memory accessible to individual users, to below the amount
necessary to build SpECTRE). Slurm commands are listed on
https://www.hpc.caltech.edu/documentation/slurm-commands. For example to ensure
you get an entire node to build on, use the following command:

```
srun [--reservation=sxs_standing] [--constraint=skylake/cascadelake/icelake] \
  -t 02:00:00 -N 1 --exclusive -D . --pty /bin/bash
```

If you are part of the SXS collaboration, you can use our reserved nodes by
specifying `--reservation=sxs_standing`. Our reserved nodes are currently
cascadelake nodes with 56 cores each. If you want to use another type of node
you can specify a `--constraint`. However, note that the reservation flag won't
work for nodes other than cascadelake.

Be sure to re-source the correct environment files once you get the interactive
node shell.

## Ocean at Fullerton

Follow the general instructions, using `ocean` for `SYSTEM_TO_RUN_ON`,
you do not need to install any dependencies, so you can skip steps 5 and 6.

## Mbot at Cornell

Follow steps 1-3 of the general instructions.

The only modules you need to load on `mbot` are `gcc/11.4.0 spectre-deps`.
This  will load everything you need, including LLVM/Clang. You
can source the environment file by running
`. $SPECTRE_HOME/support/Environments/mbot.sh` and load the modules using
`spectre_load_modules`. This offers two functions, `spectre_run_cmake_gcc`
and `spectre_run_cmake_clang` for the different compilers.
These both default to `Release` mode. If you are developing code, please use
either `spectre_run_cmake_clang -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` or
`spectre_run_cmake_clang -D SPECTRE_DEBUG=ON` (you can also use gcc).
The second command with `SPECTRE_DEBUG=ON` enables sanity checks and
optimizations. This means it can be used in production-level runs to ensure
there aren't any subtle bugs that might only arise after a decently
long simulation.
